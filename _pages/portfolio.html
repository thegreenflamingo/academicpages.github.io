I will be uploading text-based mutual fund similarity measures in this section soon. This databank contains fund-year level "review" similarity ratio either on a cross-sectional level or a time-series level. 

I borrow the idea from Hoberg and Phillips (2010ï¼Œ 2016) and Cohen et al. (2020) for their insightful research.
