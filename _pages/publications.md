**Carbon emission and asset prices: new evidence from machine learning** (with [Feng Li](https://en.saif.sjtu.edu.cn/faculty-research/li-feng))

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*We estimate a large data panel of carbon emissions by US firms with a machine learning algorithm known as XGBoost.* Presentations at *CICF 2023*, *2023CFRI&CIRF Joint Conference*, *SBSICF 2023*, *CMCSR 2023*. (Manuscript [here](https://github.com/thegreenflamingo/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_publications/carbon.pdf), slides [here](https://github.com/thegreenflamingo/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_publications/carbon_emission_pre.pdf))

Work in Progress

**Large language models as agents: ethics and preferences** (with [Shumiao Ouyang](https://www.shumiaoouyang.com/) and [Hayong yun](https://broad.msu.edu/profile/yunhayon/))

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*Large language models do exhibit consistent risk preferences to a certain extent and finetuning has some unintended consequences for their risk preferences.*

**Can Convolutional Neural Networks predict the Chinese stock market? Improved method based on large order net inflow rate** (《卷积神经网络能预测中国股市嘛？基于大单净流入率的改进方法》 in Chinese, with Yuqiao Fang and [Feng Li](https://en.saif.sjtu.edu.cn/faculty-research/li-feng))


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*We propose a simple but effective method to improve the predictability power of CNN in the Chinese Stock market.*


**Misclassified green patents** 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*Some non-green patents are misclassified as green patents (type II error), whereas some other green patents are misclassified to be non-green (type I error).*

**Peacock’s Feathers: Strategic disclosure in mutual fund annual reports** (Seems like a forever working project)

*Fund managers with good past performance tend to differentiate themselves by reporting differently to distinguish their superior investing skills.*-->
