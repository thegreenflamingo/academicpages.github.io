**Carbon emission and asset prices: new evidence from machine learning** (with [Feng Li](https://en.saif.sjtu.edu.cn/faculty-research/li-feng))

*We estimate a large data panel of carbon emissions by US firms with a machine learning algorithm known as XGBoost. We predict scope 1 carbon emissions of listed firms from 2002 to 2021. This data set has a broad coverage of 4111 firms per year as compared to 1675 firms provided by data vendors.*

Presentations at *CICF 2023*, *2023CFRI&CIRF Joint Conference*, *SBSICF 2023*, *CMCSR 2023*. (Manuscript [here](https://github.com/thegreenflamingo/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_publications/carbon.pdf), slides [here](https://github.com/thegreenflamingo/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_publications/carbon_emission_pre.pdf))


**Carbon awareness and return co-movement** (with [Feng Li](https://en.saif.sjtu.edu.cn/faculty-research/li-feng))

*This paper documents a rise in investors' carbon awareness in recent years with a novel model-free approach. We show that for companies that produce carbon emissions on a similar scale, the correlation in their stock price returns is higher. This emission-return correlation only became significant after 2012 and has been steadily increasing ever since, whereas it was barely significant before 2012.*

**Private Responsible Engagements and ESG Performance** (with [Danting Chang](https://www.glxy.sdu.edu.cn/info/1091/5914.htm) and [Guanmin Liao](https://en.rmbs.ruc.edu.cn/Faculty/Faculty/allTeacher/22dbcf0d34ad4157bedd814af4b5e70f.htm) )

*Abstract:* 

*Using unique data on institutional investors’ communications with the company management team during corporate visits, this paper reveals the existence and prevalence of institutional investors’ responsible engagement and its impact on firm ESG performances.*

Work in Progress

**Large language models as agents: ethics and preferences** (with [Shumiao Ouyang](https://www.shumiaoouyang.com/) and [Hayong yun](https://broad.msu.edu/profile/yunhayon/))

*Large language models do exhibit consistent risk preferences to a certain extent and finetuning has some unintended consequences for their risk preferences.*

**Can Convolutional Neural Networks predict the Chinese stock market? Improved method based on large order net inflow rate** (《卷积神经网络能预测中国股市嘛？基于大单净流入率的改进方法》 in Chinese, with Yuqiao Fang and [Feng Li](https://en.saif.sjtu.edu.cn/faculty-research/li-feng))


*We propose a simple but effective method to improve the predictability power of CNN in the Chinese Stock market.*


**Misclassified green patents** 

*Some non-green patents are misclassified as green patents (type II error), whereas some other green patents are misclassified to be non-green (type I error).*

**Peacock’s Feathers: Strategic disclosure in mutual fund annual reports** (Seems like a forever working project)

*Fund managers with good past performance tend to differentiate themselves by reporting differently to distinguish their superior investing skills.*-->
