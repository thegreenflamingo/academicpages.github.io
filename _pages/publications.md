**Carbon emission and asset prices: new evidence from machine learning** (with [Feng Li](https://en.saif.sjtu.edu.cn/faculty-research/li-feng))

<!---&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*We predict the carbon emissions of US-listed firms with XGBoost and find a reversed carbon premium after 2016. (This is my second-year summer paper.)* -->

<!---**Misclassified green patents** 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*Some non-green patents are misclassified as green patents (type II error), whereas some other green patents are misclassified to be non-green (type I error).*-->
