Xingjian ZHENG (郑行健)
======

Welcome to my site! I am a fifth-year PhD candidate in Finance at Shanghai Advanced Institute of Finance (SAIF), SJTU. My research interests focus on behavioral economics/finance, leveraging Fintech platforms and LLMs. My current research questions are: (1) How to persuade investors with information design on fintech platforms? and (2) What are the "cognitive" decision-making rules of LLMs as economic agents? 

My committee chair is Prof. [Feng LI](https://en.saif.sjtu.edu.cn/faculty-research/li-feng). I was also a visiting PhD student at HBS in AY2024-25, where I was advised by Prof. [Lauren COHEN](https://www.hbs.edu/faculty/Pages/profile.aspx?facId=340063). 

My first name can be pronounced as "Sing-Jan". Hope to see you in person!
