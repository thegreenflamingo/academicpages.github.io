Xingjian ZHENG (郑行健)
======

Welcome to my site! I am currently a fifth-year PhD candidate in Finance at Shanghai Advanced Institute of Finance (SAIF), SJTU. My research interests involve two questions: (1) How does fintech correct investors' behavioral biases? and (2) How can fintech (LLM, machine learning, big data, etc.) be combined with traditional asset pricing research topics? In the meantime, I am trying to understand the decision-making rules of LLM as an economic agent. 

My committee chair is Prof. [Feng LI](https://en.saif.sjtu.edu.cn/faculty-research/li-feng), and I am expected to graduate in 2026-27. I am currently visiting HBS this academic year, advised by Prof. [Lauren Cohen](https://www.hbs.edu/faculty/Pages/profile.aspx?facId=340063). 

My first name can be pronounced as "Sing-Jan". Hope to see you in person!
