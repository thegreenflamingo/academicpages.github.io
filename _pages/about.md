Xingjian ZHENG (郑行健)
======

Welcome to my site! I am currently a third-year Ph.D. candidate in Finance at Shanghai Advanced Institute of Finance (SAIF), SJTU. My research interests invlove two questions: (1) How does fintech correct investors' behavioral biases? and (2) How to combine fintech (texutual analysis, machine learning, etc.) with traditional research topics in asset pricing and corporate finance? 

I am currently working on multiple projects related to fintech. Any comment or discussion is more than welcomed. 

My committee chair is Prof. [Feng LI](https://en.saif.sjtu.edu.cn/faculty-research/li-feng), and I am expected to graduate in 2026-27.
