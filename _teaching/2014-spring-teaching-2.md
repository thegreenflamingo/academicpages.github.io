I serve as the teaching assistant for Professor [Wu Fei](https://en.saif.sjtu.edu.cn/faculty-research/wu-fei) on an MBA level course _Venture Capital and Private Equity_ from year 2021 to presesnt.

All students are assinged to pre-determined groups and should prepare for your in-class presentation. You can find the presentation cases [here](https://github.com/thegreenflamingo/academicpages.github.io/raw/master/_teaching/VCPE%20class%20presentation%20courseware.rar) or via your student ES system. In the presentation, each group has 30 minutes to deliver a summary of the case and findings from their analysis, following by a 10-minute Q&A for comments from the rest of class. The presentation should be no limits for the number of students representing the group. The presentation sequence is as follow:

    Shenzhen Capital Group (Group 2)
