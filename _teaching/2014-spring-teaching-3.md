I serve as the teaching assistant for Professor [William Li](https://en.saif.sjtu.edu.cn/faculty-research/li-william) on an EMBA/DBA level course _Big Data & Statistics_ from year 2021 to presesnt.

Students are required to install the MINITAB software before their second class. The institute has purchased software licenses in advance, and please apply for the coordinating portals before logging in. 

You can find the installation manual [here](https://github.com/thegreenflamingo/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_teaching/Minitab%20installation.pptm) or just e-mail me.
